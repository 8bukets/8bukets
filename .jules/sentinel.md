## 2024-05-23 - CSV Injection in Scraper Output
**Vulnerability:** Scraped data (e.g., post titles, authors) was written directly to CSV without sanitization. If the scraped site contained fields starting with `=, +, -, @`, Excel would execute them as formulas.
**Learning:** Even when scraping "safe" sites, the output format (CSV) can introduce vulnerabilities if the consuming application (Excel) interprets the data as executable.
**Prevention:** Sanitize all untrusted input before writing to CSV by prepending `'` to dangerous characters.
