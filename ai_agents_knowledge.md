## What is an AI agent?

Last Updated: 04/02/2026

AI agents are software systems that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks on behalf of users. They show reasoning, planning, and memory and have a level of autonomy to make decisions, learn, and adapt.

Their capabilities are made possible in large part by the multimodal capacity of generative AI and AI foundation models. AI agents can process multimodal information like text, voice, video, audio, code, and more simultaneously; can converse, reason, learn, and make decisions. They can learn over time and facilitate transactions and business processes. Agents can work with other agents to coordinate and perform more complex workflows.

## Key features of an AI agent

As explained above, while the key features of an AI agent are reasoning and acting (as described in ReAct Framework) more features have evolved over time.

- Reasoning: This core cognitive process involves using logic and available information to draw conclusions, make inferences, and solve problems. AI agents with strong reasoning capabilities can analyze data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on evidence and context.
- Acting: The ability to take action or perform tasks based on decisions, plans, or external input is crucial for AI agents to interact with their environment and achieve goals. This can include physical actions in the case of embodied AI, or digital actions like sending messages, updating data, or triggering other processes.
- Observing: Gathering information about the environment or situation through perception or sensing is essential for AI agents to understand their context and make informed decisions. This can involve various forms of perception, such as computer vision, natural language processing, or sensor data analysis.
- Planning: Developing a strategic plan to achieve goals is a key aspect of intelligent behavior. AI agents with planning capabilities can identify the necessary steps, evaluate potential actions, and choose the best course of action based on available information and desired outcomes. This often involves anticipating future states and considering potential obstacles.
- Collaborating: Working effectively with others, whether humans or other AI agents, to achieve a common goal is increasingly important in complex and dynamic environments. Collaboration requires communication, coordination, and the ability to understand and respect the perspectives of others.
- Self-refining: The capacity for self-improvement and adaptation is a hallmark of advanced AI systems. AI agents with self-refining capabilities can learn from experience, adjust their behavior based on feedback, and continuously enhance their performance and capabilities over time. This can involve machine learning techniques, optimization algorithms, or other forms of self-modification.

## What is the difference between AI agents, AI assistants, and bots?

AI assistants are AI agents designed as applications or products to collaborate directly with users and perform tasks by understanding and responding to natural human language and inputs. They can reason and take action on the users' behalf with their supervision.

AI assistants are often embedded in the product being used. A key characteristic is the interaction between the assistant and user through the different steps of the task. The assistant responds to requests or prompts from the user, and can recommend actions but decision-making is done by the user.

## Key differences

- Autonomy: AI agents have the highest degree of autonomy, able to operate and make decisions independently to achieve a goal. AI assistants are less autonomous, requiring user input and direction. Bots are the least autonomous, typically following pre-programmed rules.
- Complexity: AI agents are designed to handle complex tasks and workflows, while AI assistants and bots are better suited for simpler tasks and interactions.
- Learning: AI agents often employ machine learning to adapt and improve their performance over time. AI assistants may have some learning capabilities, while bots typically have limited or no learning.

## How do AI agents work?

Every agent defines its role, personality, and communication style, including specific instructions and descriptions of available tools.

- Persona: A well defined persona allows an agent to maintain a consistent character and behave in a manner appropriate to its assigned role, evolving as the agent gains experience and interacts with its environment.
- Memory: The agent is equipped in general with short term, long term, consensus, and episodic memory. Short term memory for immediate interactions, long-term memory for historical data and conversations, episodic memory for past interactions, and consensus memory for shared information among agents. The agent can maintain context, learn from experiences, and improve performance by recalling past interactions and adapting to new situations.
- Tools: Tools are functions or external resources that an agent can utilize to interact with its environment and enhance its capabilities. They allow agents to perform complex tasks by accessing information, manipulating data, or controlling external systems, and can be categorized based on their user interface, including physical, graphical, and program-based interfaces. Tool learning involves teaching agents how to effectively use these tools by understanding their functionalities and the context in which they should be applied.
- Model: Large language models (LLMs) serve as the foundation for building AI agents, providing them with the ability to understand, reason, and act. LLMs act as the "brain" of an agent, enabling them to process and generate language, while other components facilitate reason and action.

## What are the types of agents in AI?

AI agents can be categorized in various ways based on their capabilities, roles, and environments. Here are some key categories of agents:

There are different definitions of agent types and agent categories.

## Based on interaction

One way to categorize agents is by how they interact with users. Some agents engage in direct conversation, while others operate in the background, performing tasks without direct user input:

- Interactive partners (also known as, surface agents): Assisting us with tasks like customer service, healthcare, education, and scientific discovery, providing personalized and intelligent support. Conversational agents include Q&A, chit chat, and world knowledge interactions with humans. They are generally user query triggered and fulfill user queries or transactions.
- Autonomous background processes (also known as, background agents): Working behind the scenes to automate routine tasks, analyze data for insights, optimize processes for efficiency, and proactively identify and address potential issues. They include workflow agents. They have limited or no human interaction and are generally driven by events and fulfill queued tasks or chains of tasks.

## Based on number of agents

- Single agent: Operate independently to achieve a specific goal. They utilize external tools and resources to accomplish tasks, enhancing their functional capabilities in diverse environments. They are best suited for well defined tasks that do not require collaboration with other AI agents. Can only handle one foundation model for its processing.
- Multi-agent: Multiple AI agents that collaborate or compete to achieve a common objective or individual goals. These systems leverage the diverse capabilities and roles of individual agents to tackle complex tasks. Multi-agent systems can simulate human behaviors, such as interpersonal communication, in interactive scenarios. Each agent can have different foundation models that best fit their needs.

## Benefits of using AI agents

AI agents can enhance the capabilities of language models by providing autonomy, task automation, and the ability to interact with the real world through tools and embodiment.

## Efficiency and productivity

Increased output: Agents divide tasks like specialized workers, getting more done overall

Simultaneous execution: Agents can work on different things at the same time without getting in each other's way

Automation: Agents take care of repetitive tasks, freeing up humans for more creative work

## Improved decision-making

Collaboration: Agents work together, debate ideas, and learn from each other, leading to better decisions

Adaptability: Agents can adjust their plans and strategies as situations change

Robust reasoning: Through discussion and feedback, agents can refine their reasoning and avoid errors

## Enhanced capabilities

Complex problem-solving: Agents can tackle challenging real-world problems by combining their strengths

Natural language communication: Agents can understand and use human language to interact with people and each other

Tool use: Agents can interact with the external world by using tools and accessing information

Learning and self-improvement: Agents learn from their experiences and get better over time

## Social interaction and simulation

Realistic simulations: Agents can model human-like social behaviors, such as forming relationships and sharing information

Emergent behavior: Complex social interactions can arise organically from the interactions of individual agents

## Challenges with using AI agents

While AI agents offer many benefits, there are also some challenges associated with their use:

Tasks requiring deep empathy / emotional intelligence or requiring complex human interaction and social dynamics – AI agents can struggle with nuanced human emotions. Tasks like therapy, social work, or conflict resolution require a level of emotional understanding and empathy that AI currently lacks. They may falter in complex social situations that require understanding unspoken cues.

Situations with high ethical stakes – AI agents can make decisions based on data, but they lack the moral compass and judgment needed for ethically complex situations. This includes areas like law enforcement, healthcare (diagnosis and treatment), and judicial decision-making.

Domains with unpredictable physical environments – AI agents can struggle in highly dynamic and unpredictable physical environments where real-time adaptation and complex motor skills are essential. This includes tasks like surgery, certain types of construction work, and disaster response.

Resource-intensive applications – Developing and deploying sophisticated AI agents can be computationally expensive and require significant resources, potentially making them unsuitable for smaller projects or organizations with limited budgets.

## Deploy AI agents for scale and efficiency with Cloud Run

AI agents, with their inherent need for flexible compute power to handle reasoning, planning, and tool use, can be an excellent fit for Cloud Run. This fully managed serverless platform allows you to deploy your agent's code—often packaged within a container—as a scalable, reliable service or job. This approach abstracts away infrastructure management, letting developers concentrate on refining the agent's logic.

Cloud Run offers several features that directly support the architecture and demands of sophisticated AI agents:

- Scalability and cost-efficiency: Cloud Run automatically scales the number of container instances up to meet peak demand and, crucially, can scale down to zero when the agent is idle. This means you only pay for the exact compute resources consumed during the agent's active execution, making it cost-effective for goal-oriented, intermittent workloads.
- Agent orchestration and serving: The core agent logic—which manages the model calls, tool selection, and reasoning process—runs as a Cloud Run service. This service provides a stable HTTPS endpoint, making the agent easily accessible via an API for user-facing applications or for communication with other agents
- Agent-to-Agent, or A2A: Frameworks like the Agent Development Kit (ADK) are designed to integrate seamlessly with Cloud Run for easy deployment.

By leveraging Cloud Run's secure, auto-scaling, and flexible environment, organizations can operationalize complex single- or multi-agent systems efficiently.

## Use cases for AI agents

- Dashboard (TUI): Run `jules` without arguments for an interactive experience.

## Knowledge Merge

Knowledge Merge is a process or document that merges key concepts currently spread across Antigravity, Project SOR, the live software-online-review.com domain, and the new software-review-platform starter. It creates one canonical map of what each layer is, what role it plays, and how the project should evolve.

## Gemini CLI Remote Subagents

Gemini CLI supports connecting to remote subagents using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. This allows Gemini CLI to interact with other agents, expanding its capabilities by delegating tasks to remote services.

Gemini CLI can connect to any compliant A2A agent. You can find samples of A2A agents in the following repositories:
- ADK Samples (Python)
- ADK Python Contributing Samples

Proxy support:
Gemini CLI routes traffic to remote agents through an HTTP/HTTPS proxy if one is configured. It uses the general.proxy setting in your settings.json file or standard environment variables (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY).

Defining remote subagents:
Remote subagents are defined as Markdown files (.md) with YAML frontmatter. You can place them in:
- Project-level: .gemini/agents/*.md (Shared with your team)
- User-level: ~/.gemini/agents/*.md (Personal agents)

Configuration schema requires:
- kind (Must be remote)
- name (Unique slug)
- agent_card_url or agent_card_json
- auth (Authentication configuration)

Supported auth types:
- apiKey: Send a static API key as an HTTP header (supports dynamic values).
- http: HTTP authentication (Bearer token, Basic credentials, or any IANA-registered scheme).
- google-credentials: Uses Google Application Default Credentials (ADC) to authenticate with Google Cloud services and Cloud Run endpoints.
- oauth: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with PKCE.

Managing Subagents via commands:
- /agents list: Displays all available local and remote subagents.
- /agents reload: Reloads the agent registry.
- /agents enable <agent_name>: Enables a specific subagent.
- /agents disable <agent_name>: Disables a specific subagent.


## Gemini CLI Subagents

# Subagents

Subagents are specialized agents that operate within your main Gemini CLI session. They are designed to handle specific, complex tasks—like deep codebase analysis, documentation lookup, or domain-specific reasoning—without cluttering the main agent’s context or toolset.

## What are subagents?
Subagents are “specialists” that the main Gemini agent can hire for a specific job.

*   **Focused context:** Each subagent has its own system prompt and persona.
*   **Specialized tools:** Subagents can have a restricted or specialized set of tools.
*   **Independent context window:** Interactions with a subagent happen in a separate context loop, which saves tokens in your main conversation history.

Subagents are exposed to the main agent as a tool of the same name. When the main agent calls the tool, it delegates the task to the subagent. Once the subagent completes its task, it reports back to the main agent with its findings.

## How to use subagents
You can use subagents through automatic delegation or by explicitly forcing them in your prompt.

### Automatic delegation
Gemini CLI’s main agent is instructed to use specialized subagents when a task matches their expertise. For example, if you ask “How does the auth system work?”, the main agent may decide to call the `codebase_investigator` subagent to perform the research.

### Forcing a subagent (@ syntax)
You can explicitly direct a task to a specific subagent by using the `@` symbol followed by the subagent’s name at the beginning of your prompt. This is useful when you want to bypass the main agent’s decision-making and go straight to a specialist.

Example:

**Terminal window**
`@codebase_investigator Map out the relationship between the AgentRegistry and the LocalAgentExecutor.`

When you use the `@` syntax, the CLI injects a system note that nudges the primary model to use that specific subagent tool immediately.

## Built-in subagents

## Docker MCP Catalog

The Docker MCP Catalog is a curated collection of verified MCP servers, packaged as Docker images and distributed through Docker Hub. It solves common challenges with running MCP servers locally: environment conflicts, setup complexity, and security concerns.

The catalog serves as the source of available MCP servers. When you add servers to your profiles, you select them from the catalog. Each server runs as an isolated container, making it portable and consistent across different environments.

Note
E2B sandboxes now include direct access to the Docker MCP Catalog, giving developers access to over 200 tools and services to seamlessly build and run AI agents. For more information, see E2B Sandboxes.

What's in the catalog
The Docker MCP Catalog includes:

Verified servers: All servers are versioned with full provenance and SBOM metadata
Partner tools: Servers from New Relic, Stripe, Grafana, and other trusted partners
Docker-built servers: Locally-running servers built and digitally signed by Docker for enhanced security
Remote services: Cloud-hosted servers that connect to external services like GitHub, Notion, and Linear
Local versus remote servers
The catalog contains two types of servers based on where they run:

Local servers run as containers on your machine. They work offline once downloaded and offer predictable performance and complete data privacy. Docker builds and signs all local servers in the catalog.

Remote servers run on the provider's infrastructure and connect to external services. Many remote servers use OAuth authentication, which the MCP Toolkit handles automatically through your browser.
