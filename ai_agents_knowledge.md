## What is an AI agent?

Last Updated: 04/02/2026

AI agents are software systems that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks on behalf of users. They show reasoning, planning, and memory and have a level of autonomy to make decisions, learn, and adapt.

Their capabilities are made possible in large part by the multimodal capacity of generative AI and AI foundation models. AI agents can process multimodal information like text, voice, video, audio, code, and more simultaneously; can converse, reason, learn, and make decisions. They can learn over time and facilitate transactions and business processes. Agents can work with other agents to coordinate and perform more complex workflows.

## Key features of an AI agent

As explained above, while the key features of an AI agent are reasoning and acting (as described in ReAct Framework) more features have evolved over time.

- Reasoning: This core cognitive process involves using logic and available information to draw conclusions, make inferences, and solve problems. AI agents with strong reasoning capabilities can analyze data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on evidence and context.
- Acting: The ability to take action or perform tasks based on decisions, plans, or external input is crucial for AI agents to interact with their environment and achieve goals. This can include physical actions in the case of embodied AI, or digital actions like sending messages, updating data, or triggering other processes.
- Observing: Gathering information about the environment or situation through perception or sensing is essential for AI agents to understand their context and make informed decisions. This can involve various forms of perception, such as computer vision, natural language processing, or sensor data analysis.
- Planning: Developing a strategic plan to achieve goals is a key aspect of intelligent behavior. AI agents with planning capabilities can identify the necessary steps, evaluate potential actions, and choose the best course of action based on available information and desired outcomes. This often involves anticipating future states and considering potential obstacles.
- Collaborating: Working effectively with others, whether humans or other AI agents, to achieve a common goal is increasingly important in complex and dynamic environments. Collaboration requires communication, coordination, and the ability to understand and respect the perspectives of others.
- Self-refining: The capacity for self-improvement and adaptation is a hallmark of advanced AI systems. AI agents with self-refining capabilities can learn from experience, adjust their behavior based on feedback, and continuously enhance their performance and capabilities over time. This can involve machine learning techniques, optimization algorithms, or other forms of self-modification.

## What is the difference between AI agents, AI assistants, and bots?

AI assistants are AI agents designed as applications or products to collaborate directly with users and perform tasks by understanding and responding to natural human language and inputs. They can reason and take action on the users' behalf with their supervision.

AI assistants are often embedded in the product being used. A key characteristic is the interaction between the assistant and user through the different steps of the task. The assistant responds to requests or prompts from the user, and can recommend actions but decision-making is done by the user.

 | AI agent | AI assistant | Bot
--- | --- | --- | ---
Purpose | Autonomously and proactively perform tasks | Assisting users with tasks | Automating simple tasks or conversations
Capabilities | Can perform complex, multi-step actions; learns and adapts; can make decisions independently | Responds to requests or prompts; provides information and completes simple tasks; can recommend actions but the user makes decisions | Follows pre-defined rules; limited learning; basic interactions
Interaction | Proactive; goal-oriented | Reactive; responds to user requests | Reactive; responds to triggers or commands

## How do AI agents work?

Every agent defines its role, personality, and communication style, including specific instructions and descriptions of available tools.

- Persona: A well defined persona allows an agent to maintain a consistent character and behave in a manner appropriate to its assigned role, evolving as the agent gains experience and interacts with its environment.
- Memory: The agent is equipped in general with short term, long term, consensus, and episodic memory. Short term memory for immediate interactions, long-term memory for historical data and conversations, episodic memory for past interactions, and consensus memory for shared information among agents. The agent can maintain context, learn from experiences, and improve performance by recalling past interactions and adapting to new situations.
- Tools: Tools are functions or external resources that an agent can utilize to interact with its environment and enhance its capabilities. They allow agents to perform complex tasks by accessing information, manipulating data, or controlling external systems, and can be categorized based on their user interface, including physical, graphical, and program-based interfaces. Tool learning involves teaching agents how to effectively use these tools by understanding their functionalities and the context in which they should be applied.
- Model: Large language models (LLMs) serve as the foundation for building AI agents, providing them with the ability to understand, reason, and act. LLMs act as the "brain" of an agent, enabling them to process and generate language, while other components facilitate reason and action.

## [Accelerating Gemma 4: faster inference with multi-token prediction drafters](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/developers-tools/multi-token-prediction-gemma-4/)
### Definitions
- **Why speculative decoding?**: Standard LLM inference is memory-bandwidth bound. pairing a heavy target model (e.g., Gemma 4 31B) with a lightweight drafter (the MTP model) utilizes idle compute to “predict” future tokens.
- **How speculative decoding works**: Pairing target model with MTP drafter. If target model agrees with draft, it accepts entire sequence in single pass.

### Use Cases
- Unlocking faster AI from edge to workstation. Drastically reduce latency for near real-time chat and agentic workflows.

### Google Cloud Tools
- Gemini, Gemma, LiteRT, Hugging Face, Kaggle, vLLM, MLX
