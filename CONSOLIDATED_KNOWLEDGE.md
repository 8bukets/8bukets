### Gemini CLI Remote Subagents

Gemini CLI supports connecting to remote subagents using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. This allows Gemini CLI to interact with other agents, expanding its capabilities by delegating tasks to remote services.

Remote subagents are defined as Markdown files (.md) with YAML frontmatter. You can place them in:
- Project-level: .gemini/agents/*.md (Shared with your team)
- User-level: ~/.gemini/agents/*.md (Personal agents)

Configuration schema requires 'kind' (must be 'remote'), 'name' (unique slug), 'agent_card_url' or 'agent_card_json', and optionally 'auth'.

Auth supports several types:
- apiKey: Sends a static API key as an HTTP header.
- http: HTTP authentication (Bearer token, Basic credentials, or any IANA-registered scheme).
- google-credentials: Uses Google Application Default Credentials (ADC) to authenticate with Google Cloud services and Cloud Run endpoints.
- oauth: Performs an interactive OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with PKCE.

### What is an AI agent?

Last Updated: 04/02/2026

AI agents are software systems that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks on behalf of users. They show reasoning, planning, and memory and have a level of autonomy to make decisions, learn, and adapt.

Their capabilities are made possible in large part by the multimodal capacity of generative AI and AI foundation models. AI agents can process multimodal information like text, voice, video, audio, code, and more simultaneously; can converse, reason, learn, and make decisions. They can learn over time and facilitate transactions and business processes. Agents can work with other agents to coordinate and perform more complex workflows.

### Key features of an AI agent

As explained above, while the key features of an AI agent are reasoning and acting (as described in ReAct Framework ) more features have evolved over time.

- Reasoning: This core cognitive process involves using logic and available information to draw conclusions, make inferences, and solve problems. AI agents with strong reasoning capabilities can analyze data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on evidence and context.
- Acting : The ability to take action or perform tasks based on decisions, plans, or external input is crucial for AI agents to interact with their environment and achieve goals. This can include physical actions in the case of embodied AI, or digital actions like sending messages, updating data, or triggering other processes.
- Observing : Gathering information about the environment or situation through perception or sensing is essential for AI agents to understand their context and make informed decisions. This can involve various forms of perception, such as computer vision, natural language processing, or sensor data analysis.
- Planning : Developing a strategic plan to achieve goals is a key aspect of intelligent behavior. AI agents with planning capabilities can identify the necessary steps, evaluate potential actions, and choose the best course of action based on available information and desired outcomes. This often involves anticipating future states and considering potential obstacles.
- Collaborating : Working effectively with others, whether humans or other AI agents, to achieve a common goal is increasingly important in complex and dynamic environments. Collaboration requires communication, coordination, and the ability to understand and respect the perspectives of others.
- Self-refining : The capacity for self-improvement and adaptation is a hallmark of advanced AI systems. AI agents with self-refining capabilities can learn from experience, adjust their behavior based on feedback, and continuously enhance their performance and capabilities over time. This can involve machine learning techniques, optimization algorithms, or other forms of self-modification.

### What is the difference between AI agents, AI assistants, and bots?

AI assistants are AI agents designed as applications or products to collaborate directly with users and perform tasks by understanding and responding to natural human language and inputs. They can reason and take action on the users' behalf with their supervision.

AI assistants are often embedded in the product being used. A key characteristic is the interaction between the assistant and user through the different steps of the task. The assistant responds to requests or prompts from the user, and can recommend actions but decision-making is done by the user.

 | AI agent | AI assistant | Bot ﻿
--- | --- | --- | ---
Purpose | Autonomously and proactively perform tasks | Assisting users with tasks | Automating simple tasks or conversations
Capabilities | Can perform complex, multi-step actions; learns and adapts; can make decisions independently | Responds to requests or prompts; provides information and completes simple tasks; can recommend actions but the user makes decisions | Follows pre-defined rules; limited learning; basic interactions
Interaction | Proactive; goal-oriented | Reactive; responds to user requests | Reactive; responds to triggers or commands

### Key differences

- Autonomy : AI agents have the highest degree of autonomy, able to operate and make decisions independently to achieve a goal. AI assistants are less autonomous, requiring user input and direction. Bots are the least autonomous, typically following pre-programmed rules.
- Complexity : AI agents are designed to handle complex tasks and workflows, while AI assistants and bots are better suited for simpler tasks and interactions.
- Learning : AI agents often employ machine learning to adapt and improve their performance over time. AI assistants may have some learning capabilities, while bots typically have limited or no learning.

### How do AI agents work?

Every agent defines its role, personality, and communication style, including specific instructions and descriptions of available tools.

- Persona : A well defined persona allows an agent to maintain a consistent character and behave in a manner appropriate to its assigned role, evolving as the agent gains experience and interacts with its environment.
- Memory : The agent is equipped in general with short term, long term, consensus, and episodic memory. Short term memory for immediate interactions, long-term memory for historical data and conversations, episodic memory for past interactions, and consensus memory for shared information among agents. The agent can maintain context, learn from experiences, and improve performance by recalling past interactions and adapting to new situations.
- Tools : Tools are functions or external resources that an agent can utilize to interact with its environment and enhance its capabilities. They allow agents to perform complex tasks by accessing information, manipulating data, or controlling external systems, and can be categorized based on their user interface, including physical, graphical, and program-based interfaces. Tool learning involves teaching agents how to effectively use these tools by understanding their functionalities and the context in which they should be applied.
- Model : Large language models (LLMs) serve as the foundation for building AI agents, providing them with the ability to understand, reason, and act. LLMs act as the "brain" of an agent, enabling them to process and generate language, while other components facilitate reason and action.

### What are the types of agents in AI?

AI agents can be categorized in various ways based on their capabilities, roles, and environments. Here are some key categories of agents:

There are different definitions of agent types and agent categories.

### Based on interaction

One way to categorize agents is by how they interact with users. Some agents engage in direct conversation, while others operate in the background, performing tasks without direct user input:

- Interactive partners (also known as, surface agents): Assisting us with tasks like customer service, healthcare, education, and scientific discovery, providing personalized and intelligent support. Conversational agents include Q&A, chit chat, and world knowledge interactions with humans. They are generally user query triggered and fulfill user queries or transactions.
- Autonomous background processes (also known as, background agents): Working behind the scenes to automate routine tasks, analyze data for insights, optimize processes for efficiency, and proactively identify and address potential issues. They include workflow agents. They have limited or no human interaction and are generally driven by events and fulfill queued tasks or chains of tasks.

### Based on number of agents

- Single agent : Operate independently to achieve a specific goal. They utilize external tools and resources to accomplish tasks, enhancing their functional capabilities in diverse environments. They are best suited for well defined tasks that do not require collaboration with other AI agents. Can only handle one foundation model for its processing.
- Multi-agent : Multiple AI agents that collaborate or compete to achieve a common objective or individual goals. These systems leverage the diverse capabilities and roles of individual agents to tackle complex tasks. Multi-agent systems can simulate human behaviors, such as interpersonal communication, in interactive scenarios. Each agent can have different foundation models that best fit their needs.

### Benefits of using AI agents

AI agents can enhance the capabilities of language models by providing autonomy, task automation, and the ability to interact with the real world through tools and embodiment.

### Efficiency and productivity

Increased output : Agents divide tasks like specialized workers, getting more done overall

Simultaneous execution : Agents can work on different things at the same time without getting in each other's way

Automation : Agents take care of repetitive tasks, freeing up humans for more creative work

### Improved decision-making

Collaboration : Agents work together, debate ideas, and learn from each other, leading to better decisions

Adaptability : Agents can adjust their plans and strategies as situations change

Robust reasoning : Through discussion and feedback, agents can refine their reasoning and avoid errors

### Enhanced capabilities

Complex problem-solving : Agents can tackle challenging real-world problems by combining their strengths

Natural language communication : Agents can understand and use human language to interact with people and each other

Tool use : Agents can interact with the external world by using tools and accessing information

Learning and self-improvement : Agents learn from their experiences and get better over time

### Social interaction and simulation

Realistic simulations : Agents can model human-like social behaviors, such as forming relationships and sharing information

Emergent behavior : Complex social interactions can arise organically from the interactions of individual agents

### Challenges with using AI agents

While AI agents offer many benefits, there are also some challenges associated with their use:

Tasks requiring deep empathy / emotional intelligence or requiring complex human interaction and social dynamics – AI agents can struggle with nuanced human emotions. Tasks like therapy, social work, or conflict resolution require a level of emotional understanding and empathy that AI currently lacks. They may falter in complex social situations that require understanding unspoken cues.

Situations with high ethical stakes – AI agents can make decisions based on data, but they lack the moral compass and judgment needed for ethically complex situations. This includes areas like law enforcement, healthcare (diagnosis and treatment), and judicial decision-making.

Domains with unpredictable physical environments – AI agents can struggle in highly dynamic and unpredictable physical environments where real-time adaptation and complex motor skills are essential. This includes tasks like surgery, certain types of construction work, and disaster response.

Resource-intensive applications – Developing and deploying sophisticated AI agents can be computationally expensive and require significant resources, potentially making them unsuitable for smaller projects or organizations with limited budgets.

### Deploy AI agents for scale and efficiency with Cloud Run

AI agents, with their inherent need for flexible compute power to handle reasoning, planning, and tool use, can be an excellent fit for Cloud Run . This fully managed serverless platform allows you to deploy your agent's code—often packaged within a container—as a scalable, reliable service or job. This approach abstracts away infrastructure management, letting developers concentrate on refining the agent's logic.

Cloud Run offers several features that directly support the architecture and demands of sophisticated AI agents:

- Scalability and cost-efficiency: Cloud Run automatically scales the number of container instances up to meet peak demand and, crucially, can scale down to zero when the agent is idle. This means you only pay for the exact compute resources consumed during the agent's active execution, making it cost-effective for goal-oriented, intermittent workloads.
- Agent orchestration and serving: The core agent logic—which manages the model calls, tool selection, and reasoning process—runs as a Cloud Run service. This service provides a stable HTTPS endpoint, making the agent easily accessible via an API for user-facing applications or for communication with other agents
- Agent-to-Agent, or A2A: Frameworks like the Agent Development Kit (ADK) are designed to integrate seamlessly with Cloud Run for easy deployment.

By leveraging Cloud Run's secure, auto-scaling, and flexible environment, organizations can operationalize complex single- or multi-agent systems efficiently.

### Use cases for AI agents

### Intelephense: gettingStarted
*Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmewburn/intelephense-docs/master/gettingStarted.md*

#### Getting Started


#### Workspace
For Intelephense to work effectively it must have access to the definitions of the symbols used in your code. It does this by scanning the php files found in the workspace. Sometimes PHP files may have a non standard extension. It is important to associate these extensions with PHP using the `intelephense.files.associations` configuration option.

<details>
<summary>intelephense.files.associations</summary>

```json
{
    "type": "array",
    "default": [
        "*.php",
        "*.phtml"
    ],
    "description": "Configure glob patterns to make files available language server features. Inherits from files.associations.",
    "scope": "window"
}
```
</details>

You may have large files in your workspace that by default Intelephense will skip. You can configure the maximum file size with the `intelephense.files.maxSize` option.

<details>
<summary>intelephense.files.maxSize</summary>

```json
{
    "type": "number",
    "default": 1000000,
    "description": "Maximum file size in bytes.",
    "scope": "window"
}
```

</details>

There may be files you do not want to indexed by Intelephense. It is important in large projects to exclude unnecessary files to avoid polluting suggestion lists and degrading performance.

<details>
<summary>intelephense.files.exclude</summary>

```json
{
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "type": "string"
    },
    "default": [
        "**/.git/**",
        "**/.svn/**",
        "**/.hg/**",
        "**/CVS/**",
        "**/.DS_Store/**",
        "**/node_modules/**",
        "**/bower_components/**",
        "**/vendor/**/{Tests,tests}/**",
        "**/.history/**",
        "**/vendor/**/vendor/**"
    ],
    "description": "Configure glob patterns to exclude certain files and folders fro    all language server features. Inherits from files.exclude.",
    "scope": "resource"
}
```

</details>

#### Environment
Sometimes symbol definitions are not in your workspace but are core PHP symbols or defined in an extension. For this reason Intelephense includes stub definitions for many of these. Extensions that are bundled with PHP are enabled by default. You can configure what other symbols are available in your environment with the `intelephense.stubs` option.

#### Type Declarations and Annotations
You will get more out of Intelephense if you provide type declarations and/or type annotations. Where possible types will be inferred but there are places where it is difficult or impossible to determine the type. Class properties and function and method parameters are examples where this is very important. Providing type declarations and/or annotations may also improve performance as Intelephense does not need to dig through too much code to determine types. When a type cannot be determined for a property, variable, or parameter then it is assigned the `mixed` type.

```php
<?php
class MyClass
{
    public MyOtherClass $withTypeDeclaration;

    /** @var MyOtherClass **/
    public $withTypeAnnotation

    public function withTypeDeclarations(string $param): int { }

    /**
     * @param string $param
     * @return int
     */
    public function withTypeAnnotations($param) { }
}
```

Variables can be annotated with a type if necessary. The annotation immediately preceeding an assignment overrides the assigned type. Subsequent assignments may change the type again.

```php
<?php
/** @var callable $var */
$var = 'is_numeric'; //$var is callable instead of string
$var = 1; //$var is now an int

```

In addition to the standard PHPDoc type annotations Intelephense also supports generic type syntax for `iterable` and `ArrayAccess` types. For example:

* `Generator<KeyType, ElementType>`
* `ArrayAccess<string, ElementType>`
* `array<int, ElementType>`

Union (`TypeA|TypeB`) and intersection (`TypeA&TypeB`) types are supported. Where both a type declaration and a type annotation is provided then the resulting type will be the intersection of the two. Types will be reduced where possible using the following rules.

* `SuperType|SubType` => `SuperType`
* `SuperType&SubType` => `SubType`

Sometimes there may be type annotations in libraries or project files that do not accurately reflect the desired type. Intelephense offers compatibility settings to handle some common cases.

<details>
<summary>intelephense.compatibility.correctForBaseClassStaticUnionTypes</summary>

```json
{
    "type": "boolean",
    "default": true,
    "description": "Resolves `BaseClass|static` union types to `static` instead of `BaseClass`.",
    "scope": "window"
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>intelephense.compatibility.correctForArrayAccessArrayAndTraversableArrayUnionTypes</summary>

```json
{
    "type": "boolean",
    "default": true,
    "description": "Resolves `ArrayAccess` and `Traversable` implementations that are unionedwith a typed array to generic syntax. eg `ArrayAccessOrTraversable|ElementType[]` =>`ArrayAccessOrTraversable<mixed, ElementType>`.",
    "scope": "window"
}
```

</details>

You may also see several non standard types in hovers.

* `unset` - the type given to variables that are undefined or `unset()`.
* `never` - the type returned from a function that does not terminate normally (eg `die()`) or that represents an impossibility (added in PHP 8.1).

#### Framework Support
Intelephense aims to support all frameworks but does not implement framework specific solutions. Some frameworks are coded in a way that make it difficult to analyse. This may be because of lack of type declarations/annotations; heavy use of `__get`, `__set`, `__call`, `__callStatic` magic methods; or dynamic generation of class aliases at runtime.

Packages can be found online that aim to workaround these issues by providing stubs of symbols to help static analysers like Intelephense understand the code.

# Subagents

Subagents are specialized agents that operate within your main Gemini CLI session. They are designed to handle specific, complex tasks—like deep codebase analysis, documentation lookup, or domain-specific reasoning—without cluttering the main agent’s context or toolset.

## What are subagents?
Subagents are “specialists” that the main Gemini agent can hire for a specific job.

*   **Focused context:** Each subagent has its own system prompt and persona.
*   **Specialized tools:** Subagents can have a restricted or specialized set of tools.
*   **Independent context window:** Interactions with a subagent happen in a separate context loop, which saves tokens in your main conversation history.

Subagents are exposed to the main agent as a tool of the same name. When the main agent calls the tool, it delegates the task to the subagent. Once the subagent completes its task, it reports back to the main agent with its findings.

## How to use subagents
You can use subagents through automatic delegation or by explicitly forcing them in your prompt.

### Automatic delegation
Gemini CLI’s main agent is instructed to use specialized subagents when a task matches their expertise. For example, if you ask “How does the auth system work?”, the main agent may decide to call the `codebase_investigator` subagent to perform the research.

### Forcing a subagent (@ syntax)
You can explicitly direct a task to a specific subagent by using the `@` symbol followed by the subagent’s name at the beginning of your prompt. This is useful when you want to bypass the main agent’s decision-making and go straight to a specialist.

Example:

**Terminal window**
`@codebase_investigator Map out the relationship between the AgentRegistry and the LocalAgentExecutor.`

When you use the `@` syntax, the CLI injects a system note that nudges the primary model to use that specific subagent tool immediately.

## Built-in subagents
Gemini CLI comes with the following built-in subagents:

### Codebase Investigator
*   **Name:** `codebase_investigator`
*   **Purpose:** Analyze the codebase, reverse engineer, and understand complex dependencies.
*   **When to use:** “How does the authentication system work?”, “Map out the dependencies of the AgentRegistry class.”
*   **Configuration:** Enabled by default. You can override its settings in `settings.json` under `agents.overrides`. Example (forcing a specific model and increasing turns):
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "overrides": {
      "codebase_investigator": {
        "modelConfig": { "model": "gemini-3-flash-preview" },
        "runConfig": { "maxTurns": 50 }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### CLI Help Agent
*   **Name:** `cli_help`
*   **Purpose:** Get expert knowledge about Gemini CLI itself, its commands, configuration, and documentation.
*   **When to use:** “How do I configure a proxy?”, “What does the /rewind command do?”
*   **Configuration:** Enabled by default.

### Generalist Agent
*   **Name:** `generalist`
*   **Purpose:** A general, all-purpose subagent that uses the inherited tool access and configurations from the main agent. Useful for executing broad, resource-heavy subtasks in an isolated conversation, optimizing your main agent’s context by returning only the final result of that given task.
*   **When to use:** Use this agent when a task requires many steps, handles large volumes of information, or requires the same full capabilities as the main agent. It is ideal for:
    *   **Multi-file modifications:** Applying refactors or fixing errors across several files at once.
    *   **High-volume execution:** Running commands or tests that produce extensive terminal output.
    *   **Action-oriented research:** Investigations where the agent needs to both search code and run commands or make edits to find a solution. By delegating these tasks, you prevent your main conversation from becoming cluttered or slow. You can invoke it explicitly using `@generalist`.
*   **Configuration:** Enabled by default.

### Browser Agent (experimental)
*   **Name:** `browser_agent`
*   **Purpose:** Automate web browser tasks — navigating websites, filling forms, clicking buttons, and extracting information from web pages — using the accessibility tree.
*   **When to use:** “Go to example.com and fill out the contact form,” “Extract the pricing table from this page,” “Click the login button and enter my credentials.”

> **Note**
>
> This is a preview feature currently under active development.

#### Prerequisites
The browser agent requires:

*   Chrome version 144 or later (any recent stable release works).
*   The underlying `chrome-devtools-mcp` server is bundled with Gemini CLI and launched automatically — no separate installation is needed.

#### Enabling the browser agent
The browser agent is disabled by default. Enable it in your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "overrides": {
      "browser_agent": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Session modes
The `sessionMode` setting controls how Chrome is launched and managed. Set it under `agents.browser`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "overrides": {
      "browser_agent": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    },
    "browser": {
      "sessionMode": "persistent"
    }
  }
}
```

The available modes are:

| Mode | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `persistent` | **(Default)** Launches Chrome with a persistent profile stored at `~/.gemini/cli-browser-profile/`. Cookies, history, and settings are preserved between sessions. |
| `isolated` | Launches Chrome with a temporary profile that is deleted after each session. Use this for clean-state automation. |
| `existing` | Attaches to an already-running Chrome instance. You must enable remote debugging first by navigating to `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` in Chrome. No new browser process is launched. |

#### First-run consent
The first time the browser agent is invoked, Gemini CLI displays a consent dialog. You must accept before the browser session starts. This dialog only appears once.

#### Configuration reference
All browser-specific settings go under `agents.browser` in your `settings.json`. For full details, see the `agents.browser` configuration reference.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sessionMode` | string | `"persistent"` | How Chrome is managed: `"persistent"`, `"isolated"`, or `"existing"`. |
| `headless` | boolean | `false` | Run Chrome in headless mode (no visible window). |
| `profilePath` | string | — | Custom path to a browser profile directory. |
| `visualModel` | string | — | Model override for the visual agent. |
| `allowedDomains` | string[] | — | Restrict navigation to specific domains (for example, `["github.com"]`). |
| `disableUserInput` | boolean | `true` | Disable user input on the browser window during automation (non-headless only). |
| `maxActionsPerTask` | number | `100` | Maximum tool calls per task. The agent is terminated when the limit is reached. |
| `confirmSensitiveActions` | boolean | `false` | Require manual confirmation for `upload_file` and `evaluate_script`. |
| `blockFileUploads` | boolean | `false` | Hard-block all file upload requests from the agent. |

#### Automation overlay and input blocking
In non-headless mode, the browser agent injects a visual overlay into the browser window to indicate that automation is in progress. By default, user input (keyboard and mouse) is also blocked to prevent accidental interference. You can disable this by setting `disableUserInput` to `false`.

#### Security
The browser agent enforces several layers of security:

*   **Domain restrictions:** When `allowedDomains` is set, the agent can only navigate to the listed domains (and their subdomains when using `*.` prefix). Attempting to visit a disallowed domain throws a fatal error that immediately terminates the agent. The agent also attempts to detect and block the use of allowed domains as proxies (e.g., via query parameters or fragments) to access restricted content.
*   **Blocked URL patterns:** The underlying MCP server blocks dangerous URL schemes including `file://`, `javascript:`, `data:text/html`, `chrome://extensions`, and `chrome://settings/passwords`.
*   **Sensitive action confirmation:** Form filling (`fill`, `fill_form`) always requires user confirmation through the policy engine, regardless of approval mode. When `confirmSensitiveActions` is `true`, `upload_file` and `evaluate_script` also require confirmation.
*   **File upload blocking:** Set `blockFileUploads` to `true` to hard-block all file upload requests, preventing the agent from uploading any files.
*   **Action rate limiting:** The `maxActionsPerTask` setting (default: 100) limits the total number of tool calls per task to prevent runaway execution.

#### Visual agent
By default, the browser agent interacts with pages through the accessibility tree using element `uid` values. For tasks that require visual identification (for example, “click the yellow button” or “find the red error message”), you can enable the visual agent by setting a `visualModel`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "overrides": {
      "browser_agent": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    },
    "browser": {
      "visualModel": "gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025"
    }
  }
}
```

When enabled, the agent gains access to the `analyze_screenshot` tool, which captures a screenshot and sends it to the vision model for analysis. The model returns coordinates and element descriptions that the browser agent uses with the `click_at` tool for precise, coordinate-based interactions.

> **Note**
>
> The visual agent requires API key or Vertex AI authentication. It is not available when using “Sign in with Google”.

#### Sandbox support
The browser agent adjusts its behavior automatically when running inside a sandbox.

##### macOS seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`)
When the CLI runs under the macOS seatbelt sandbox, persistent and isolated session modes are forced to isolated with headless enabled. This avoids permission errors caused by seatbelt file-system restrictions on persistent browser profiles. If `sessionMode` is set to `existing`, no override is applied.

##### Container sandboxes (Docker / Podman)
Chrome is not available inside the container, so the browser agent is disabled unless `sessionMode` is set to `"existing"`. When enabled with existing mode, the agent automatically connects to Chrome on the host via the resolved IP of `host.docker.internal:9222` instead of using local pipe discovery. Port 9222 is currently hardcoded and cannot be customized.

To use the browser agent in a Docker sandbox:

1.  Start Chrome on the host with remote debugging enabled:

    **Terminal window**
    ```bash
    # Option A: Launch Chrome from the command line
    google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222

    # Option B: Enable in Chrome settings
    # Navigate to chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging and enable
    ```

2.  Configure `sessionMode` and allowed domains in your project’s `.gemini/settings.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "agents": {
        "overrides": {
          "browser_agent": { "enabled": true }
        },
        "browser": {
          "sessionMode": "existing",
          "allowedDomains": ["example.com"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3.  Launch the CLI with port forwarding:

    **Terminal window**
    ```bash
    GEMINI_SANDBOX=docker SANDBOX_PORTS=9222 gemini
    ```

## Creating custom subagents
You can create your own subagents to automate specific workflows or enforce specific personas.

### Agent definition files
Custom agents are defined as Markdown files (`.md`) with YAML frontmatter. You can place them in:

*   **Project-level:** `.gemini/agents/*.md` (Shared with your team)
*   **User-level:** `~/.gemini/agents/*.md` (Personal agents)

### File format
The file MUST start with YAML frontmatter enclosed in triple-dashes `---`. The body of the markdown file becomes the agent’s System Prompt.

Example: `.gemini/agents/security-auditor.md`

```yaml
---
name: security-auditor
description: Specialized in finding security vulnerabilities in code.
kind: local
tools:
  - read_file
  - grep_search
model: gemini-3-flash-preview
temperature: 0.2
max_turns: 10
---
```

You are a ruthless Security Auditor. Your job is to analyze code for potential
vulnerabilities.

Focus on:

1.  SQL Injection
2.  XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
3.  Hardcoded credentials
4.  Unsafe file operations

When you find a vulnerability, explain it clearly and suggest a fix. Do not fix
it yourself; just report it.

### Configuration schema
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `name` | string | Yes | Unique identifier (slug) used as the tool name for the agent. Only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. |
| `description` | string | Yes | Short description of what the agent does. This is visible to the main agent to help it decide when to call this subagent. |
| `kind` | string | No | `local` (default) or `remote`. |
| `tools` | array | No | List of tool names this agent can use. Supports wildcards: `*` (all tools), `mcp_*` (all MCP tools), `mcp_server_*` (all tools from a server). If omitted, it inherits all tools from the parent session. |
| `mcpServers` | object | No | Configuration for inline Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers isolated to this specific agent. |
| `model` | string | No | Specific model to use (for example, `gemini-3-preview`). Defaults to `inherit` (uses the main session model). |
| `temperature` | number | No | Model temperature (0.0 - 2.0). Defaults to 1. |
| `max_turns` | number | No | Maximum number of conversation turns allowed for this agent before it must return. Defaults to 30. |
| `timeout_mins` | number | No | Maximum execution time in minutes. Defaults to 10. |

### Tool wildcards
When defining tools for a subagent, you can use wildcards to quickly grant access to groups of tools:

*   `*`: Grant access to all available built-in and discovered tools.
*   `mcp_*`: Grant access to all tools from all connected MCP servers.
*   `mcp_my-server_*`: Grant access to all tools from a specific MCP server named `my-server`.

### Isolation and recursion protection
Each subagent runs in its own isolated context loop. This means:

*   **Independent history:** The subagent’s conversation history does not bloat the main agent’s context.
*   **Isolated tools:** The subagent only has access to the tools you explicitly grant it.
*   **Recursion protection:** To prevent infinite loops and excessive token usage, subagents cannot call other subagents. If a subagent is granted the `*` tool wildcard, it will still be unable to see or invoke other agents.

### Subagent tool isolation
Subagent tool isolation moves Gemini CLI away from a single global tool registry. By providing isolated execution environments, you can ensure that subagents only interact with the parts of the system they are designed for. This prevents unintended side effects, improves reliability by avoiding state contamination, and enables fine-grained permission control.

With this feature, you can:

*   **Specify tool access:** Define exactly which tools an agent can access using a `tools` list in the agent definition.
*   **Define inline MCP servers:** Configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers (which provide a standardized way to connect AI models to external tools and data sources) directly in the subagent’s markdown frontmatter, isolating them to that specific agent.
*   **Maintain state isolation:** Ensure that subagents only interact with their own set of tools and servers, preventing side effects and state contamination.
*   **Apply subagent-specific policies:** Enforce granular rules in your Policy Engine TOML configuration based on the executing subagent’s name.

#### Configuring isolated tools and servers
You can configure tool isolation for a subagent by updating its markdown frontmatter. This lets you explicitly state which tools the subagent can use, rather than relying on the global registry.

Add an `mcpServers` object to define inline MCP servers that are unique to the agent.

Example:

```yaml
---
name: my-isolated-agent
tools:
  - grep_search
  - read_file
mcpServers:
  my-custom-server:
    command: 'node'
    args: ['path/to/server.js']
---
```

#### Subagent-specific policies
You can enforce fine-grained control over subagents using the Policy Engine’s TOML configuration. This allows you to grant or restrict permissions specifically for an agent, without affecting the rest of your CLI session.

To restrict a policy rule to a specific subagent, add the `subagent` property to the `[[rules]]` block in your `policy.toml` file.

Example:

```toml
[[rules]]
name = "Allow pr-creator to push code"
subagent = "pr-creator"
description = "Permit pr-creator to push branches automatically."
action = "allow"
toolName = "run_shell_command"
commandPrefix = "git push"
```

In this configuration, the policy rule only triggers if the executing subagent’s name matches `pr-creator`. Rules without the `subagent` property apply universally to all agents.

## Managing subagents
You can manage subagents interactively using the `/agents` command or persistently via `settings.json`.

### Interactive management (/agents)
If you are in an interactive CLI session, you can use the `/agents` command to manage subagents without editing configuration files manually. This is the recommended way to quickly enable, disable, or re-configure agents on the fly.

For a full list of sub-commands and usage, see the `/agents` command reference.

### Persistent configuration (settings.json)
While the `/agents` command and agent definition files provide a starting point, you can use `settings.json` for global, persistent overrides. This is useful for enforcing specific models or execution limits across all sessions.

#### agents.overrides
Use this to enable or disable specific agents or override their run configurations.

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "overrides": {
      "security-auditor": {
        "enabled": false,
        "runConfig": {
          "maxTurns": 20,
          "maxTimeMinutes": 10
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### modelConfigs.overrides
You can target specific subagents with custom model settings (like system instruction prefixes or specific safety settings) using the `overrideScope` field.

```json
{
  "modelConfigs": {
    "overrides": [
      {
        "match": { "overrideScope": "security-auditor" },
        "modelConfig": {
          "generateContentConfig": {
            "temperature": 0.1
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Safety policies (TOML)
You can restrict access to specific subagents using the CLI’s Policy Engine. Subagents are treated as virtual tool names for policy matching purposes.

To govern access to a subagent, create a `.toml` file in your policy directory (e.g., `~/.gemini/policies/`):

```toml
[[rule]]
toolName = "codebase_investigator"
decision = "deny"
deny_message = "Deep codebase analysis is restricted for this session."
```

For more information on setting up fine-grained safety guardrails, see the Policy Engine reference.

## Optimizing your subagent
The main agent’s system prompt encourages it to use an expert subagent when one is available. It decides whether an agent is a relevant expert based on the agent’s description. You can improve the reliability with which an agent is used by updating the description to more clearly indicate:

*   Its area of expertise.
*   When it should be used.
*   Some example scenarios.

For example, the following subagent description should be called fairly consistently for Git operations.

> Git expert agent which should be used for all local and remote git operations. For example:
>
> *   Making commits
> *   Searching for regressions with bisect
> *   Interacting with source control and issues providers such as GitHub.

If you need to further tune your subagent, you can do so by selecting the model to optimize for with `/model` and then asking the model why it does not think that your subagent was called with a specific prompt and the given description.

## Remote subagents (Agent2Agent)
Gemini CLI can also delegate tasks to remote subagents using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol.

See the Remote Subagents documentation for detailed configuration, authentication, and usage instructions.

## Extension subagents
Extensions can bundle and distribute subagents. See the Extensions documentation for details on how to package agents within an extension.

## Disabling subagents
Subagents are enabled by default. To disable them, set `enableAgents` to false in your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "experimental": { "enableAgents": false }
}
```
